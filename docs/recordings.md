`freeclimb recordings`
======================

A Recording instance resource represents an audio file created by FreeClimb during a Call or Conference. The Recording resource is a subresource of a Call resource and Conference resource. This enables navigating directly from a Call or Conference to the Recordings generated from them. Recordings are owned by an account and are stored for the account holder on FreeClimb until deleted. There are two ways to begin a Recording:

* [`freeclimb recordings:delete RECORDINGID`](#freeclimb-recordingsdelete-recordingid)
* [`freeclimb recordings:download RECORDINGID`](#freeclimb-recordingsdownload-recordingid)
* [`freeclimb recordings:get RECORDINGID`](#freeclimb-recordingsget-recordingid)
* [`freeclimb recordings:list`](#freeclimb-recordingslist)
* [`freeclimb recordings:stream RECORDINGID`](#freeclimb-recordingsstream-recordingid)
