## `freeclimb conferences:create`

Create an empty Conference within the specified account. The status of a conference will be reported to the statusCallbackUrl when: Participants can be added to a Conference once the statusCallbackUrl is invoked, signifying the Conference has been created and is empty. When a populated or inProgress Conference is terminated, this URL is called twice — once when the Conference becomes empty and then again when it is terminated. Note This is a notification only. Any PerCL returned by the application is ignored. The statusCallbackUrl is invoked using HTTP POST with the following parameters (in addition to the standard request parameters).

```
USAGE
  $ freeclimb conferences:create

OPTIONS
  -a, --alias=alias                          A description for this Conference. Maximum 64 characters.

  -b, --playBeep=playBeep                    Controls when a beep is played. Valid values: always, never, entryOnly,
                                             exitOnly.

  -h, --help                                 show CLI help

  -r, --record=true|false                    Setting to true records the entire Conference.

  -s, --statusCallbackUrl=statusCallbackUrl  This URL is invoked when the status of the Conference changes. For more
                                             information, see statusCallbackUrl (below).

  -w, --waitUrl=waitUrl                      If specified, a URL for the audio file that provides custom hold music for
                                             the Conference when it is in the populated state. Otherwise, FreeClimb uses
                                             a system default audio file. This is always fetched using HTTP GET and is
                                             fetched just once — when the Conference is created.
